Troubleshooting Steps:
1. Check user's internet connection
2. Verify if issue is specific to certain Bible passages
3. Check API rate limiting status for user
4. Review recent error logs for user's account
5. Test study generation with different input types

If unresolved: Escalate to Tier 2 with detailed logs
```

**App Performance Issues:**
```
Support Script:
"I'm sorry you're experiencing slow performance. Let's try some quick troubleshooting steps."

Troubleshooting Steps:
1. Check device specifications against minimum requirements

```

### **Tier 2 Support (Technical Issues)**

**Advanced Troubleshooting:**

**Database/Sync Issues:**
```sql
-- User data synchronization check
SELECT 
  sg.id,
  sg.created_at,
  sg.updated_at,
  sg.sync_status,
  u.email
FROM study_guides sg
JOIN auth.users u ON sg.user_id = u.id
WHERE u.email = '[USER-EMAIL]'
ORDER BY sg.updated_at DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Check for sync conflicts
SELECT 
  user_id,
  COUNT(*) as pending_syncs,
  MIN(created_at) as oldest_pending
FROM sync_queue 
WHERE user_id = '[USER-ID]'
AND status = 'pending'
GROUP BY user_id;
```

**API Integration Issues:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# user-api-diagnostics.sh

USER_ID="$1"
USER_EMAIL="$2"

echo "Diagnosing API issues for user: $USER_EMAIL"

# Check recent API calls
supabase logs --type api --grep "$USER_ID" --start "$(date -d '24 hours ago' -Iseconds)"

# Check rate limiting status
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer [SERVICE-KEY]" \
  "https://[PROJECT-URL].supabase.co/rest/v1/rate_limits?user_id=eq.$USER_ID"

# Test study generation for user
curl -X POST "https://[PROJECT-URL].supabase.co/functions/v1/study-generate" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer [USER-JWT]" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "input_type": "scripture",
    "input_value": "John 3:16",
    "jeff_reed_step": "observation"
  }' \
  -w "\nResponse time: %{time_total}s\nHTTP code: %{http_code}\n"
```

**Study Content Issues:**
```javascript
// Content quality review
async function reviewStudyContent(studyId) {
  const study = await supabase
    .from('study_guides')
    .select('*')
    .eq('id', studyId)
    .single();
    
  const contentReview = {
    theological_accuracy: await validateTheological(study.data),
    content_appropriateness: await checkAppropriate(study.data),
    format_compliance: await validateFormat(study.data),
    bible_references: await validateReferences(study.data.related_verses)
  };
  
  return {
    study_id: studyId,
    review_results: contentReview,
    requires_manual_review: contentReview.theological_accuracy.score < 80,
    recommended_action: determineAction(contentReview)
  };
}
```

### **Tier 3 Support (Critical Issues)**

**Security Incident Response:**
```
Immediate Actions:
1. Activate security incident response team
2. Document all user-reported details
3. Preserve evidence and logs
4. Follow Security Incident Response procedures
5. Coordinate with legal team if data breach suspected

User Communication:
"Thank you for reporting this security concern. We take security very seriously and are investigating immediately. For your security, we recommend changing your password and reviewing your account activity. We will update you within 2 hours with our findings."
```

**Data Loss Recovery:**
```sql
-- Attempt data recovery from backups
WITH recent_backups AS (
  SELECT backup_time, backup_id
  FROM backup_catalog
  WHERE user_id = '[USER-ID]'
  AND backup_time > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
  ORDER BY backup_time DESC
)
SELECT 
  rb.backup_time,
  sg.id as study_guide_id,
  sg.summary,
  sg.created_at
FROM recent_backups rb
JOIN backup_study_guides sg ON rb.backup_id = sg.backup_id
WHERE sg.user_id = '[USER-ID]';

-- If recovery possible, restore from most recent backup
