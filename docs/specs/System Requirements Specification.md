# **üìÑ System Requirements Specification (SRS)**

**Project Name:** Disciplefy: Bible Study\
**Version:** 1.0\
**Author:** Fenn Ignatius Saji\
**Date:** July 2025

## **1. ‚úÖ Functional Requirements**

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **ID**   **Feature**      **Description**
  -------- ---------------- --------------------------------------------------
  FR-01    Input Query      Users can input either a Bible reference (e.g.,
                            "John 3:16") or a topic (e.g., "forgiveness").

  FR-02    Guide Generation The system will generate a contextual study guide
                            using an AI model trained or tuned on Bible
                            content.

  FR-03    Study Guide      Each guide includes: Summary, Historical Context,
           Output           Related Verses, Reflection Questions, and Prayer
                            Points.

  FR-04    Response Storage Recent guides (5--10 per user) are stored locally
                            or in the cloud for reuse.

  FR-05    Shareable Format Output can be shared via WhatsApp, email, or
                            copyable text.

  FR-06    Optional         Google/Apple login (via Firebase) allows syncing
           Authentication   of saved content across devices.

  FR-07    Jeff Reed Study  For predefined topics, users can access a 4-step
           Flow             structured study: Context, Scholar Guide, Group
                            Discussion, and Application.

  FR-08    Feedback         Users can rate the relevance of guides and leave
           Submission       written feedback.

  FR-09    Topic            Predefined Jeff Reed topics are localized and
           Localization     cached client-side.

## **2. üîí Non-Functional Requirements**

### **‚è±Ô∏è Performance**

- LLM response time must be under 3 seconds on average.

- Cached or repeated queries should return in under 1 second.

### **üîê Security**

- Use Firebase Auth or Supabase Auth for secure login sessions.

- Encrypted HTTPS communication enforced across all endpoints.

- Protect against prompt injection and prompt hijacking by sanitizing
  user inputs.

- PII storage is minimized; access is authenticated and role-based.

### **‚öôÔ∏è Scalability**

- Support at least 50--100 concurrent users initially.

- Architecture should scale to 5,000+ users via autoscaling (Cloud
  Functions, Supabase Edge Functions).

- LLM backend should be modular to support provider switching (OpenAI,
  Claude, etc.).

- Portable backend to work on Firebase/GCP or Supabase without vendor
  lock-in.

## **3. üìò Use Cases and User Stories**

### **‚úÖ Use Case 1: Generate Bible Study Guide**

**Actor:** Logged-in or anonymous user\
**Steps:**

1.  User inputs \"Romans 12:1\" or \"faith\"

2.  App checks cache (client/server-side)

3.  If not cached, backend sends query to LLM

4.  Structured response returned to frontend

5.  User views, saves, or shares guide

### **‚úÖ Use Case 2: Save and Revisit Guides**

**Actor:** Logged-in user\
**Steps:**

1.  User generates a study guide

2.  App stores the guide_id in user history

3.  On future login, the user can revisit and re-share the saved guides

### **‚úÖ Use Case 3: Jeff Reed Guided Study**

**Actor:** Logged-in or anonymous user\
**Steps:**

1.  User selects predefined topic like "Grace"

2.  App fetches cached or fresh 4-step guide

3.  Each step (Context, Scholar Guide, Discussion, Application) is
    displayed individually

4.  User completes steps progressively; timestamps are optionally logged

### **‚úÖ User Story: Pastor Daniel**

"As a pastor, I want to input a verse and get a concise but deep
explanation I can use for my Sunday sermon."

### **‚úÖ User Story: Sister Anjali**

"As a churchgoer, I want to input a topic and receive a short reflection
and prayer that I can share with my prayer group."

### **‚úÖ User Story: Dev Team**

"As a developer, I want to ensure the backend is low-latency and
cost-efficient, so we don't need to scale infra manually."

Let me know if you\'d like a diagram for any of the flows above or turn
this into a testable checklist.
