**Project Name:** Disciplefy - Bible Study App

**Vision:**
To transform believers into disciples through structured Bible study, personalized fellowship, and guided discipleship paths. Our mission is to make spiritual growth accessible and accountable in a digital-first world. The approach is deeply inspired by the practices of the Early Church—focused on communal learning, mentorship, and growth in faith through shared discipleship.

**Problem Statement:**
Despite the availability of Bible apps and devotionals, there’s a gap in structured, mentor-guided discipleship. Most believers remain passive consumers of faith content, lacking accountability, community, and progression toward spiritual maturity.

**Solution:**
Disciplefy is a mobile-first app offering:

* Daily Bible study generation with contextual study guides.
* Structured, mentor-led Discipleship Paths from Seeker to Disciple Maker.
* Fellowship rooms for group-based learning and discussions.
* Mentorship-based fellowship progress tracking.
* Dual progress systems for users and fellowships.

**Key Features:**
1. **Home Screen**: Daily verse, Bible study generator.
2. **Discipleship Paths**: 5-stage journey (Seeker → Believer → Follower → Disciple → Disciple Maker).
3. **Fellowship Rooms**: Created by mentors; private spaces for invited users to access and discuss discipleship lessons.
4. **Fellowship Progress Tracking**: Mentors can mark lesson completion for their group.
5. **Mentor System**: Users are promoted to mentors after completing both their personal and any one fellowship discipleship path.

**Target Audience:**
* Churchgoers, pastors, home groups.
* Small fellowships, youth groups, and Christian leaders.
* Initially targeting 50–100 weekly active users.

**Monetization Plan:**
* Free access with limited daily studies.
* ₹1000+ donors unlock unlimited study generation and all discipleship paths.
* Church partnership licensing for bulk usage.

**Milestones:**
* MVP (Daily Study + Fellowship Room + Seeker Path): 4–6 weeks.
* Full Path Completion & Fellowship Progress System: 3 months.
* Mentorship Automations and Analytics: 6 months.

**Closing Thought:**
Discipleship is not a Sunday affair—it’s a lifestyle. Disciplefy aims to equip every believer to grow deeper in faith and build communities centered around Christ. With your support, we can disciple the digital generation.
