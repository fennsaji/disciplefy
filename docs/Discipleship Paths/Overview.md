**Project Name:** Disciplefy - Bible Study App

**Vision:**
To transform believers into disciples through structured Bible study, personalized fellowship, and guided discipleship paths. Our mission is to make spiritual growth accessible and accountable in a digital-first world. The approach is deeply inspired by the practices of the Early Church—focused on communal learning, mentorship, and growth in faith through shared discipleship.

**Problem Statement:**
Despite the availability of Bible apps and devotionals, there's a gap in structured, mentor-guided discipleship. Most believers remain passive consumers of faith content, lacking accountability, community, and progression toward spiritual maturity.

**Solution:**
Disciplefy is a mobile-first app offering:

* Daily Bible study generation with contextual study guides.
* Structured, mentor-led Discipleship Paths from Seeker to Disciple Maker.
* Fellowship rooms for group-based learning and discussions.
* Mentorship-based fellowship progress tracking.
* Dual progress systems for users and fellowships.
* Multi-language support (English, Hindi, Malayalam).
* Discussion forums for fellowship engagement.
