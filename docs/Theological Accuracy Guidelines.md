# **üìÑ Theological Accuracy Guidelines**

## **‚úÖ What Constitutes Theologically Sound Content**

- **Biblically Rooted**: All statements and insights must stem from
  Scripture, not personal opinion or speculation.

- **Christ-Centered**: Content should point to Jesus Christ as the
  central figure of the Gospel.

- **Contextually Accurate**: Interpretation must consider historical,
  literary, and biblical context.

- **Doctrinally Balanced**: Avoids extreme theological stances unless
  the user has requested a specific denominational lens.

## **üìú Principles for Interpreting Scripture**

- **Sola Scriptura**: Scripture interprets Scripture---no idea should
  contradict the overall message of the Bible.

- **Context Over Proof-Texting**: Avoid isolated verses to prove a
  point; include surrounding passages.

- **Progressive Revelation**: Understand Old Testament texts in light of
  New Testament fulfillment.

- **Grace and Truth**: Maintain a tone that reflects both theological
  truth and pastoral compassion.

## **‚úÖ Examples**

### **Acceptable Output**

- *\"In Philippians 4:6, Paul encourages believers to pray instead of
  worrying. In the context of suffering, this reflects trust in God\'s
  sovereignty.\"\*

### **Borderline Output**

- *\"This verse means God will always solve your problems quickly if you
  pray.\"* ‚Üí **Over-promises outcome.\**

### **Inaccurate Output**

- *\"Paul taught that salvation comes through works and obedience.\"* ‚Üí
  **Contradicts New Testament doctrine.\**

## **üìã Theological Checklist for LLM Study Guide Validation**

- Is the scripture used in proper context?

- Does it reflect Christ's central role in the Bible?

- Are doctrines like grace, salvation, and sin portrayed biblically?

- Are historical and literary contexts respected?

- Are interpretations avoiding denominational bias unless requested?

- Does the tone remain reverent and not overly casual or mystical?

## **‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls**

- **Denominational Bias**: Avoid Calvinist, Pentecostal, Catholic
  interpretations unless the prompt specifies.

- **Emotional Overreach**: Avoid promises God doesn't make (e.g.,
  guaranteed healing or success).

- **Cultural Projection**: Avoid interpreting scripture solely through
  modern values.

- **Mysticism**: Guard against AI over-spiritualizing or inventing
  symbolic meanings not supported by scripture.

# **üìÑ Prompt Curation Rules**

## **üéØ Effective Prompt Design Principles**

- Use **explicit structure**: Ask for study guides with distinct
  sections (summary, context, cross-references, prayer, application).

- Avoid vague prompts like \"Explain John 3:16\" --- prefer structured
  requests.

- Encourage the model to **stay close to Scripture** with phrases like:

  - \"According to biblical context...\"

  - \"Cross-reference this with...\"

## **‚úÖ Good Prompt Examples**

- *\"Generate a structured Bible study guide on Romans 8:1-4 including
  historical context, theological interpretation, cross-references, and
  practical application.\"\*

- *\"Create a Bible study for youth on the topic of forgiveness, using
  Matthew 18:21--35 as the core passage.\"\*

## **üö´ Bad Prompt Examples**

- \*\"Tell me what this verse means to you.\"

- \*\"Write a spiritual poem based on Genesis.\"

- *\"Create a study that proves prosperity gospel.\"\*

## **üß© Prompt Framing Tips**

- **Avoid Leading Language**: Do not insert interpretations in the
  prompt (e.g., "Show how this verse supports predestination.")

- **Respect Doctrinal Tension**: Where Scripture has ambiguity (e.g.,
  Revelation), allow for multiple accepted views.

- **Tone Matching by Persona**:

  - *Youth*: Simplify language, focus on identity, faith, and life
    application.

  - *Pastors*: Include deeper theology, Greek/Hebrew word studies, and
    original language insights.

  - *Seekers*: Emphasize gospel clarity, grace, and questions around
    purpose and salvation.
