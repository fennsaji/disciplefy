Happy Saturday, Disciplefy family!

This week's discussion question:

"What's ONE thing you've learned from the Bible this week 
that you want to apply in your life?"

I'll go first: I've been studying Philippians 4:6-7 about 
anxiety and prayer. This week I'm trying to pray FIRST 
before worrying about problems. It's hard but powerful!
