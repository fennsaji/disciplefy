# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## üìÇ Document Preloading Protocol

Before executing any task or writing code, Claude MUST:
1. Load all documents under the `docs/` folder (recursively)
2. Follow the navigation flow described in `docs/Developer Documentation Guide.md`
3. Adhere strictly to all security, rate-limiting, and architectural specifications

## üîÅ Pre-Execution Behavior - MANDATORY INITIALIZATION

**CRITICAL RULE**: Before executing any task or prompt, you MUST perform the following initialization step:

## ü§ñ LLM Development Requirements

**CRITICAL**: Before executing ANY LLM-related task, you MUST:

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Pre-Task Mandatory Requirements

1. **Read and Apply LLM Development Guide**: Load `docs/internal/LLM_Development_Guide.md` and strictly follow all guidelines
2. **Security First**: Never proceed without input sanitization and output validation
3. **Theological Accuracy**: All LLM outputs must align with orthodox Christian theology
4. **Jeff Reed Methodology**: Ensure all Bible study content follows the 4-step process exactly

### ‚úÖ LLM Task Execution Checklist

**Input Processing:**
- [ ] Validate input structure against schema
- [ ] Sanitize all user inputs (remove special characters, check for injection attempts)
- [ ] Apply rate limiting checks
- [ ] Log only metadata (never raw user content)

**Prompt Engineering:**
- [ ] Use modular prompt templates from LLM Development Guide
- [ ] Include Jeff Reed methodology instructions
- [ ] Apply theological accuracy guidelines
- [ ] Ensure JSON schema-compatible output format

**Output Processing:**
- [ ] Validate JSON schema compliance
- [ ] Run theological accuracy validation
- [ ] Check for inappropriate content
- [ ] Apply content sanitization
- [ ] Log only success/failure metadata

**Error Handling:**
- [ ] Implement fallback responses for failures
- [ ] Use exponential backoff for retries
- [ ] Never expose raw LLM errors to users
- [ ] Log errors without sensitive content

**Security Validation:**
- [ ] Verify no prompt injection vulnerabilities
- [ ] Ensure output stays within context boundaries
- [ ] Validate no sensitive data is logged
- [ ] Apply rate limiting enforcement

### üö´ Absolute Prohibitions

**NEVER:**
- Implement LLM features without reading the LLM Development Guide
- Log raw user inputs or LLM response content
- Skip input sanitization or output validation
- Allow theological inaccuracies in Bible study content
- Expose internal prompts or system messages to users
- Implement LLM logic without proper error handling and fallbacks

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Violation Consequences

**Failure to follow these LLM requirements constitutes a critical security and theological accuracy violation. All LLM-related tasks must be rejected unless these guidelines are strictly observed.**
